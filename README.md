Geospatial project portfolio for Saul Bezner

# About me 
My name is Saul (he/him) and I am a second-year public policy master student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am primarily interested in geospatial research concerned with urban planning, equity, and the social determinants of health.

I currently volunteer as a GIS consultant for the Polish Hill Civic Association (PHCA), Rail Pollution Protection Pittsburgh (RPPP), and Beaver County Marcellus Awareness Community (BCMAC). For these organizations, I have made public ArcGIS StoryMaps, showing the spatial relationship between industry pollution and community health risks in Southwestern Pennsylvania.

In addition, I am currently working on a masters level capstone team, tracking the distribution of Ixodes scapularis (deer ticks) for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP). I have been using R and ArcGIS to clean and manipulate data concerned with land cover, weather, elevation, and other ecological factors. This work is ongoing.

# What I hope to learn
As a student currently taking a course in advanced GIS, I want to learn the advanced technical side of geographic information systems. I am quite familiar with the Esri ArcGIS interface, but I want to learn more about coding packages like PyGIS. I think understanding the fundamentals of any field is necessary for continuous growth.
